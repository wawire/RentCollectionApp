# Authorization Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Role-Based System ✅
- **SystemAdmin**: Full access to everything
- **Landlord**: Owns properties, full access to their data
- **Caretaker**: Works for a landlord, manages day-to-day operations
- **Accountant**: Read-only financial access for a landlord
- **Tenant**: Future self-service portal

### 2. Data Ownership ✅
- Added `LandlordId` to `ApplicationUser` table
- Added `LandlordId` to `Property` table
- Caretakers and Accountants have a `LandlordId` (which landlord they work for)
- Landlords' own UserID serves as their LandlordId

### 3. JWT Claims ✅
Updated `AuthService` to include `LandlordId` in JWT token:
- SystemAdmin: No LandlordId (sees all)
- Landlord: LandlordId = their own UserId
- Caretaker/Accountant: LandlordId = their employer's UserId

### 4. Current User Service ✅
Created `ICurrentUserService` and implementation:
- Gets current user from HTTP context
- Provides: UserId, Email, Role, LandlordId
- Helper properties: IsSystemAdmin, IsLandlord, IsCaretaker, IsAccountant

### 5. Property Service Filtering ✅
Updated `PropertyService`:
- `GetAllPropertiesAsync()`: Filters by LandlordId (except SystemAdmin sees all)
- `GetPropertyByIdAsync()`: Checks access permission before returning
- `CreatePropertyAsync()`: Auto-sets LandlordId based on current user

### 6. Service Registration ✅
Registered `CurrentUserService` in DI container (`Program.cs`)

## ⏳ What Still Needs to Be Done

### 7. Complete PropertyService Updates ⏳
Need to update:
- `UpdatePropertyAsync()`: Add permission check
- `DeletePropertyAsync()`: Add permission check
- `GetPropertiesPaginatedAsync()`: Add filtering

### 8. Update Other Services ⏳
Apply same filtering logic to:
- **UnitService**: Filter units by property's LandlordId
- **TenantService**: Filter tenants by property's LandlordId
- **PaymentService**: Filter payments by tenant's LandlordId
- **DashboardService**: Aggregate stats only for user's accessible data

### 9. Controller Authorization Attributes ⏳
Add role-based `[Authorize]` attributes:
```csharp
// Only Landlords and SystemAdmin can delete properties
[Authorize(Roles = "SystemAdmin,Landlord")]
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteProperty(int id)

// Accountants can view but not modify
[Authorize(Roles = "SystemAdmin,Landlord,Caretaker")]
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreatePayment(...)

[Authorize(Roles = "SystemAdmin,Landlord,Caretaker,Accountant")]
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetPayments(...)
```

### 10. Database Migration ⏳ **CRITICAL**
Create and apply migration for new columns:
```bash
# From src/RentCollection.API directory:
dotnet ef migrations add AddLandlordIdColumns --project ../RentCollection.Infrastructure
dotnet ef database update --project ../RentCollection.Infrastructure
```

### 11. Seed Data Update ⏳
The seeder creates landlords, but existing properties in your database don't have `LandlordId` set.

Options:
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Drop database and recreate (loses existing data)
  ```bash
  dotnet ef database drop --force
  dotnet ef database update
  ```

- **Option B**: Manually update existing properties via SQL:
  ```sql
  -- Assign first 3 properties to Landlord 1
  UPDATE Properties SET LandlordId = '<landlord1-user-id>' WHERE Id IN (1, 2, 3)

  -- Assign next 3 properties to Landlord 2
  UPDATE Properties SET LandlordId = '<landlord2-user-id>' WHERE Id IN (4, 5, 6)
  ```

### 12. Frontend Updates ⏳
- Remove hardcoded demo credentials from login page
- Fetch demo users from API endpoint instead
- Hide/show UI elements based on user role:
  - Caretakers can't see "Delete Property" button
  - Accountants can't see "Add Tenant" button
  - Show appropriate warnings when creating records

### 13. Frontend Auth Types Update ⏳
Update TypeScript auth types to include `landlordId`:
```typescript
// src/RentCollection.WebApp/lib/types/auth.types.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: string;
  landlordId?: string; // ADD THIS
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  lastLoginAt?: string;
}
```

## 🎯 Testing Plan

Once all steps are complete, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: Landlord 1 Login
```
Email: landlord1@example.com
Password: Landlord@123

Expected:
✅ See only their 3 properties (once properties are assigned)
✅ Can create new properties
✅ Can edit their properties
✅ Can delete their properties
❌ Cannot see Landlord 2's properties
```

### Test 2: Landlord 2 Login
```
Email: landlord2@example.com
Password: Landlord@123

Expected:
✅ See only their 3 properties
❌ Cannot see Landlord 1's properties
```

### Test 3: Caretaker Login
```
Email: caretaker@example.com
Password: Caretaker@123

Expected:
✅ See only Landlord 1's properties (their employer)
✅ Can add tenants, record payments
❌ Cannot delete properties
❌ Cannot see financial analytics
❌ Cannot see Landlord 2's data
```

### Test 4: Accountant Login
```
Email: accountant@example.com
Password: Accountant@123

Expected:
✅ Can view Landlord 1's financial data
✅ Can generate reports
❌ Cannot add/edit tenants
❌ Cannot record payments
❌ Cannot send SMS
```

### Test 5: System Admin Login
```
Email: admin@rentcollection.com
Password: Admin@123

Expected:
✅ See ALL 6 properties from both landlords
✅ Full access to everything
```

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps for You

1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin claude/review-work-plan-01Eizmxv3Nzd4bRG5xZoiuZW
   ```

2. **Create Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd src/RentCollection.API
   dotnet ef migrations add AddLandlordIdColumns --project ../RentCollection.Infrastructure
   ```

3. **Drop and Recreate Database** (Easiest for development):
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database drop --force --project ../RentCollection.Infrastructure
   dotnet ef database update --project ../RentCollection.Infrastructure
   ```

4. **Restart API**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Test Login** with different users and verify data filtering

6. **Let me know** if it's working or if you encounter errors

---

## ✅ What Should Work Now

After migration:
- ✅ Different users get different JWT tokens with correct claims
- ✅ Properties are filtered by LandlordId
- ✅ Property creation auto-assigns LandlordId
- ✅ Permission checks prevent unauthorized access

## ❌ What Won't Work Yet

- ❌ Units/Tenants/Payments still show all data (not filtered)
- ❌ Dashboard shows global stats (not filtered by user)
- ❌ Some CRUD operations lack permission checks
- ❌ Frontend doesn't hide buttons based on role

---

## 💡 Do You Want Me To Continue?

I can continue implementing:
1. ✅ Complete PropertyService permission checks
2. ✅ Update Units, Tenants, Payments, Dashboard services with filtering
3. ✅ Add controller authorization attributes
4. ✅ Update frontend to respect roles
5. ✅ Remove hardcoded credentials from login

Just let me know and I'll continue! The foundation is now solid.
